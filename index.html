    <h1>Unfussy Flags for CSS Practice</h1>
    <h2>Context: Why Did I do This?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm learning a bit of HTML and CSS, because who doesn't need more ways to fill
        their time on this earth? (Truly, though, learning is fun.) In the course I'm
        taking (shout-out to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">App Brewery London</a> ),
        we applied some basic CSS shapes and positioning to make the flag of Laos. That
        exercise was inspired by Michael Lascarcides and his <a href="http://lascarid.es/fussyflags/">Fussy Flag project</a>,
        and in turn inspired this exercise to help me push my skills a little further.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did not go wild when selecting the flags duplicated and presented here. On
        Lascarides's scale, these are all "three Palau" flags (or fewer), meaning they are pretty
        simple in their design. I chose this because I am a baby programmer who still has 
        to be kindof bad at this before I can get good at it. Plus, about 25% of the 
        world's flags are three Palaus (or fewer) in design, so I feel like I'm in good
        company here.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll also notice that all three of these flags are from the top of the alphabet.
        That is because I chose the first three in Lascarides's list that struck my fancy,
        partly by way of keeping myself from procrastinating. Which I'm still currently
        doing as I type this. So.
    </p>
    <p>
        Time to get to work!
